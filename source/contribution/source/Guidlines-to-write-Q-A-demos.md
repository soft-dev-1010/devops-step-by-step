## The Guidelines you should follow when writing a Q/A demo.
- First of all these guidelines are meant to raise the quality, in the following guide we will have what we should do and what we shouldn't do, and what are the metrics you should follow to achieve your goal of keeping up your tutorial organized, simple, and clear. 

- One more thing We should keep in mind that to achieve the best we should try to keep our pictures symmetrical to each other that means keep all of them in the same ratio in terms of width and height and that gives the reader a feeling of the quality that you are trying to achieve, even if you miss small minor things if the big picture looks good it will leave a first good impression and that last.

- You can find the PowerPoint Template here in this [Link](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/source/contribution/assets/templates/qa-template.pptx). 

**Note: Please Don't use Dark mode with Windows/VS/Browser, by anyhow since we are using red squares to highlight and it won't make it visible.**

1.this is the structure we should have before we start working, a folder for Not edited& edited pics, script, and our Powerpoint Temp.

2.You Should re-watch the session tutorial to follow the same steps used in the session, also you can start taking notes for the steps you need to follow.

If you're using the assignment link as a reference along with the session video please keep in mind to restructure the steps written to be more clear with the steps in the pictures.

For example :  

1.Navigate to Azure Portal -> Create a resource -> Web App -> resource group: create one -> Intance Details -> name: mywebappdevopscourse (It has to be unique name) -> Runtime stack: .NET6 (LTS) -> Review + Create -> Create.

This all in one step it's better to structure them along with the picture rather than all of them on top and followed by three or four pictures so you should structure it like this. 

1.Navigate to Azure Portal -> Create a resource.

2.Web App -> resource group: create one -> </br>
IMG . </br>
and so on.

3.We will be using the Windows snipping tool to use that we will press start + Shit + S at the same time as shown in the picture, after that

we will choose 3rd option "Window Snip" to be able to take a full screenshot for a specific window.

Windows snipping tool can be used while watching the session video since it's not using Ctrl c or ctrl v, it saves the whole snip.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/03-Snpping-tool.PNG)

4.You can notice that we highlighted the chrome and the window snip option only highlighted the chrome without the taskbar.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/04-WindowModeUsage.PNG)

5.After you are done taking all the tutorial pictures you need in 1 folder let's start the editing.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/05-ScreenShotstaken.PNG)

6.Open your PowerPoint temp.

6.1 Right-click on the slide on the left bar then copy and paste the same slide to match the screenshots for the tutorial you made in the previous picture we have 11 pictures so will make 11 copies of that slide.

6.2 Our highlight square with a weight of "1 1/2 pt".

6.3 Our tools panel for steps it's designed to be out the slide to easily drag and drop and deleted afterward the elements we didn't use as we will see in the follow-up pictures.

our numbers circles width and Height are "0.47 inch" and weight of "1".

6.4 Our static black border with a weight of "2 1/4 pt".

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/06-TempWorkSpace.PNG)

7.Now let's drag and drop picture by picture to each slide pic 001 to slide 1 etc...

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/07-DragAndDrop.PNG)

8.It's time to start the editing, Right click the picture you dragged and dropped then select " Send to back ".

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/08-SendToBack.PNG)

9.After we select send to back we can see that our black pic is centered and we can see our black border in line with our pic and it perfectly fits it.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/09-SendToBackView.PNG)

10.When we try to highlight any step i usually zoom in by using Ctrl + mouse wheel to be able to fit the highlighted square perfectly for the step.

In the 2nd square on the cloned Repository, we can see it's poorly not fit the box of Clone and it's a bad practice to leave it like this.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/010-HighlightBorderWrapping.PNG)

11.For the pic steps i need 6 steps so i copy and paste my highlight square a few times then i will start zooming in for each step and make it perfectly fit the highlighted option as you will see in the next picture.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/011-MultipleHighlightedBorder.PNG)

12.You can notice that i have done all 6 steps and as we mentioned before i can fully highlight the panel i used to delete all the elements i didn't use.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/012-DoneWrapping.PNG)

13.In the picture we can see a few bad practices that should never be used let's break it down.

13.1 We have a power template that we should never change its elements like Number 2 there is a green border.

13.2 You should never try to use arrows like in this picture since it doesn't look clean and is not necessary to be able to understand.

13.3 3-4-5 circles are shrunk down to assume they fit the small boxes but it gives out a bad outcome if you go back to Pic 12 and compare you can notice the difference.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/013-BadWrapping.PNG)

14.This is a bad demonstration of how to use arrows We will describe why and when to use arrows but arrows are not meant to be used like this since there are steps in this picture that need to be described so the first look you will be lost since you won't know which arrow you should start with.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/014-WrongArrowUsage.PNG)

15.This is a good example of how to use arrows to demonstrate since the step contains a sequence step that step 2 is depend on step 1 so instead of highlighting over and over, we show up by the arrow that we should copy/drag from the first folder to iis folder at the 2nd folder.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/015-GoodArrowUseage.PNG)

16.This is a good example of how to use arrows In this tutorial, we mentioned earlier that you should go to docker hub and copy the pull command on a keep it in a separate - Notepad.

To show up that we will copy a certain part of the command to a specific location the arrow is used to show up where to paste the highlighted box in our CD pipeline.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/016-GoodArrowUesage.PNG)

17.We will see examples of stretching picture when to do it and when you should never do it cuz it will show up a bad quality.

In this picture, i wasn't able to take it in full screen so it was smaller than the other pictures used but note that it was of good quality since it has been taken by windows snip in order to achieve good quality.

In this case, we have 2 Options first stretch up the picture from right and left as the arrows point out.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/017-Stretching.PNG)

18.This is the outcome of the stretching, it doesn't look any different since the PowerPoint ratio for the screen is 1600*900 and the picture was 1300 * 830.

So it's not a huge difference and you won't be able to tell the difference if i didn't take it as a reference.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/018-stretched.PNG)

19.The 2nd option is Re-size the black border to fit the picture, the issue with this option is that auto-save at the end it will require you to use the snipping tool or crop the image again to be able to use it.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/019-BlackBorderWrapping.PNG)

20.At the end you will learn how to save all the slides you have done, and this will be the output you will see as we mentioned before it will require more work to be adjusted to delete the white spaces.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/020-WhiteSides.PNG)

21.You can use the "photos" app to crop down the image open the image with "Photos" App Then Press Ctrl+E to enter edit mode and you can drag the pic from the sides to be able to delete the white areas then save it and it's ready.

Only use this option if stretching the picture will make it looks bad or you can't use option 1 in step 18.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/021-EditingWhiteSides.PNG)

22.This is an example of bad practice of stretching, this example is not accepted at all.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/022-BadStretching.PNG)

23.When i should take screenshots out of a session video?

You can take screenshots out of the video if you going to achieve good quality, for example, the test plan tutorial requires you to have a paid subscription, so you can take pictures from the session video as a reference.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/023-SessionScreenShot.PNG)

24.This is not the best can be taken out of the video in terms of quality clearness.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/024-BadQuality.PNG)

25.1 This example is not acceptable since it has a timestamp.

25.2 The border around go-to resource it's not fully rounded it looks a  bit odd.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/025-TimeStamp.PNG)

26.When you demonstrate a tutorial and you will be using CMD or Linux terminal try to make the text visible in this picture you can see the text is small.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/026-CMDSmallFont.PNG)

27.In this picture we can see that our font is bigger is 24 and it's visible and you don't need to zoom in to see the cmd details anymore to change the CMD font follow the steps in the following picture.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/027-CMDBigFont.PNG)

28.Right-click on the cmd bar then click properties.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/028-FontChange.PNG)

29.Navigate to font then choose the font to be 24.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/029-FontChange.PNG)

30.It's time to save our work Press on file.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/030-WorkSaving.PNG)

31.1 Select Save As.

31.2 Select Browse.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/031-SaveAs.PNG)

32.1 Select PNG or JPEG format.

32.2 Click Save.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/032-SaveAsPNG.PNG)

33.Select All Slides.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/033-AllSlides.PNG)

34.You can notice that we have a new folder created tutorial temp, you copy the pics inside to the edited folder or rename the folder this is a personal preference.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/034-TempGen.PNG)

35.Now it's time to review the work and write down the script (this is a personal preference you can do it while watching the video on Step 2.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/035-ScriptTyping.PNG)

36.Let's upload to the platform.

36.1 First i copy down from my written script.

36.2 Press on the Highlighted icon to start uploading pictures.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/036-PlatUpload.PNG)

37.1 Click on choose file and navigate to the destination where is your saved pics and select the first pic to upload.

37.2 Click on Send it to Server.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/037-SendPic.PNG)

38.It will automatically send you to this section now let's edit the Width to 800 and it will automatically put the height to 450. 

Note: The Max Width you can use on Q&A Plat is 800.

![](/source/contribution/assets/images/Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos/038-ResizePics.PNG)

39.This is what our pic should look like after upload.

In-depth guide about numeration.
As mentioned earlier in Step 2, If you're using Kareem assignment thread as a reference you should consider making your own numeration sequence, therefore, I will show 2 examples of references and how I made my own numeration.

The first one you can find it here to view all of it including the pics.

 <a href="https://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/?qa=389/what-are-the-steps-creating-azure-account-examine-services">Examine Azure DevOps docs, create org, and examine all the services</a>

In Kareem thread it was in 2 steps

Navigate to [Azure DevOps Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops)& Examine each Azure DevOps sub-platform.

Create Azure DevOps account : Navigate to Azure DevOps -> start free -> sign in -> fill in the other details ->Create DevOps Organization -> Create Project name -> Choose Project visibility: Private -> Advanced -> Choose Version Control: Git -> Work item process : Agile -> Create Project -> (Start examine all Azure DevOps services)

But I did consider my own numeration steps and I did assemble it down to 6 steps instead of 2 then each step can consider multi-steps in a sequence that can be followed like this for example 
step 5 has a sequence of 5 steps so I did consider to be clear as much as I can to make steps as following 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4.

And if by any chance step number 5.4 have a sequence of 3 steps as well I will be doing it as the following 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.4.3.

Why should I use numeration instead of Bullet points?

Because as a demo writer it's much easier to make references for a certain step for example if I'm in step 40 and want to mention something related as i used it in the beginning of this answer " As mentioned earlier in Step 2 " 
it's much easier with many steps since you can't refer to a certain bullet point inside a certain step.

The 2nd example is :

[Create CI for API](https://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/?qa=321/what-are-the-steps-to-create-ci-for-api)

When I took kareem as a ref I took the 6 steps and created 10 steps out of them.

How to avoid having so many grammar and punctuation mistakes?

By using a tool called [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) you can download as an extension to your browser and you will be pleased with the result.

And as M.Radwan always says the learning is incremental, You don't have to start over from the beginning, you must start where the others end, So it's highly prefer to read all reviewer points for the Q/A closed issues in the [DevOps EE Project](https://github.com/users/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/projects/2).
