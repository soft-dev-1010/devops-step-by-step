# Types of Contribution

If you want to contribute to the community you first need to know what are the available types of contributions in that community.

On this page, you can find all that you need to be able to contribute effectively to the community.

## GitHub

The first place you can contribute is [GitHub](https://github.com/), and you will find below the contribution types that you can do on GitHub.

### Opening Issues

The first type is [opening issues](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/issues/new) in Github.

Issues examples:

- Improvement ideas.
- Questions to elaborate on specific topics, that weren't asked before, so make sure to check the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
- Pending Q&A/GitHub Product Backlog Item (PBI).

**You can find Pending PBI [here](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps?tab=projects)**

### Reacting to Issues

Reacting to issues is considered a huge contribution because it lets the collaborators and moderators know the traction on a specific topic or if multiple students have the same problem/question.

### Fixing typos

Fixing typos in the repo ensures that it is professional and well maintained which also reflects the quality of content being offered.

If any typo is found, simply fork the repo, fix the typo, and then do a PR, keeping in mind our [Contribution Culture](contribution-culture.md)

## Q&A Platform

Our [Q&A Platform](https://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/) is the place where all our Knowledge Base is located! and thus it is paramount that we keep it tidy and updated!

Below you will find the types of contributions that you can provide on the Q&A Platform.

### Answering Questions

Answering questions is one of the highly appreciated community contributions anyone can provide Since it means you want to spread knowledge as well as take out of your own time to help others!

However, there are some things to know before jumping in and starting to ask/answer questions.

#### What to do before Answering?

Before answering any questions you need to read the [FAQ](../../faq.md) and watch this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3sPXx4Hzmw)

Also consider reading this question [here](http://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/?qa=65/what-i-need-to-do-before-using-our-q%26a-platform&show=66#a66).

### Asking Questions

Asking questions is one of the ways that a CoP grows, whereas members ask questions about problems they face, and others help them solve these problems.

That means when asking others for help and their time, you need to be concise and to the point without wasting the reader's time.

So before asking any questions consider going through the list below.

#### What to do before asking questions?

Before asking any questions make sure to watch and understand how to build a knowledge base through this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3sPXx4Hzmw).

Also, make sure to read [Rules for writing our questions](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/issues/2).

### Upvoting and Downvoting Questions

Upvoting and Downvoting Questions are just as important as asking questions, same with GitHub reactions.

Reacting to questions means you either find this Question informative, or a waste of time and taking the effort to show that to other members is a valuable part of your contribution!

# How to Contribute?

## Github

### How to Contribute to Github?

GitHub is built on being Open source and so is this Repo, if you want to find Product Backlog Items to work on you can go [here](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps?tab=projects).

The next step is to reach Rehab on Discord and inform her about your interest to work on a specific topic (Issue Number).

Make sure to read our [Contribution Culture](contribution-culture.md) before committing any work.

### When to open an Issue and when to open a pull request?

A general rule of thumb is Open an Issue when there will be any change to the information contained without the repo.

Any typo fixing can be done without opening an Issue.

## Q&A

### Can I answer any question that is asked in the Q&A?

Usually, there are 2 types of questions asked on the Q&A platform:

_The First type_ is a Product Backlog Item (PBI), like [this](http://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/?qa=511/what-are-the-steps-make-deploy-infrastructure-application&show=511#q511). This type of questions is more of a tutorial/demo style of questions that are assigned to contributors by Rehab and Mohamed Radwan.

_The Second type_ is a general question like [this](http://devopsvisionsqa.mohamedradwan.com/?qa=194/the-code-coverage-value-lines-lower-than-the-minimum-value-60%25), where anyone can answer!


### Where to find PBI items/Questions to answer?

You can find PBI [here](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps?tab=projects).

If you cannot find any new items, you can always reach out to Rehab and see if there will be any new items that will be added to the PB.

### What are the steps to do when I find a question I want to answer?

After finding a question you want to answer mention that in the issue's comments.

### What are the guidelines to follow when answering Q&A

We have strict Guidelines to follow when working with Q&A to maintain high quality, you can find them [here](Guidlines-to-write-Q-A-demos.md).
