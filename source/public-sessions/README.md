Discover how AI can transform your data management practices, enhance your reporting capabilities, and present data in more insightful and actionable ways.

## Demo (3): Effective Release Pipelines with YAML and Azure DevOps

Discover the power of AI in optimizing release pipelines during our comprehensive demo focused on YAML and Azure DevOps. This demo will guide you through the process of using AI tools to author a YAML file, crucial for building and publishing a web package artifact to a designated drop location in Azure DevOps.

We will also delve into how AI can assist in creating Terraform configurations for setting up infrastructure within Azure DevOps. Attendees will learn how to modify the YAML file to not only publish the infrastructure package but also to use it for establishing the necessary infrastructure.

Following the infrastructure setup, the demo will demonstrate how to amend the YAML configuration to retrieve the previously published web package and deploy it onto the newly created infrastructure. This end-to-end demonstration will cover everything from initial build setup to deployment, showcasing how AI can streamline each step of the release pipeline.

This demo is ideal for DevOps engineers, infrastructure architects, and anyone involved in CI/CD processes who wants to enhance their pipeline efficiency using the latest AI tools and technologies in Azure DevOps.

## Demo (4): Effective Team Collaboration and Meetings with Microsoft Teams

In this insightful demo, we explore the integration of AI tools with Microsoft Teams to revolutionize team collaboration and meeting management. Discover how AI can be employed to extract actionable items directly from meeting transcripts, compile comprehensive meeting minutes, and assign deadlines and responsibilities for each action item.

Additionally, we will demonstrate the capability of AI to create succinct summaries of meetings, capturing key points and decisions to enhance communication and record-keeping. The session will also cover how to use AI to draft follow-up emails, specifically designed to engage team members regarding their assigned tasks, ensuring accountability and progress.

Furthermore, attendees will learn how to use AI to develop guidelines based on discussions held during meetings, providing clear directives and enhancing team understanding and compliance.

This demo is perfect for team leaders, project managers, and any professional looking to leverage Microsoft Teams more effectively for improved productivity and collaboration.

## Demo (5): Effective Education and Training with Office 365 and Microsoft Teams Quiz

This demo, is on harnessing AI to enhance education and training through Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. This demo will illustrate the innovative use of AI to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and adapt these into "select all that apply" formats, tailored for interactive learning assessments. Participants will learn how AI can not only assist in creating these questions but also in compiling a corresponding answer sheet.

The demo will proceed to show how these AI-generated questions can be seamlessly integrated into a Microsoft Teams Quiz. Attendees will gain insights into how to utilize quiz responses as data inputs for AI to accurately calculate scores and further transform this data into informative visualization charts.

Discover how AI can simplify the creation of educational materials, enhance assessment techniques, and provide deeper insights into learning outcomes through advanced data visualization.

## Demo (6): Effective Education and Training with Office 356 and Microsoft Teams Attending (2) 

This demo will explore the capabilities of AI in enhancing education and training attendance analytics in this practical demonstration using Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. This demo will showcase how AI can be leveraged to compute the total hours attended and the attendance percentage for each participant across multiple meetings, utilizing data extracted from Microsoft Teams' attendee reports.

Participants will learn how to use AI to aggregate and analyze attendance data efficiently, allowing for the creation of detailed attendance profiles for each attendee. We will also demonstrate how to transform these insights into clear, visual charts that provide an at-a-glance understanding of attendance trends and participation levels.

This demo is perfect for educators, corporate trainers, and team leaders looking to monitor engagement and participation more effectively within their virtual classrooms or meetings.
